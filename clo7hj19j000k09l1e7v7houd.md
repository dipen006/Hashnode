## What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system which is developed by Linus Torvalds in the year 1991. many students think that to code a good operating system they must need to know an exceptional amount of coding and a few other skills.

But the Amazing fact is when Linus Torvalds developed Linux in 1991 he was a student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, USA.

Today after so many years Linux has now become one of the most popular operating systems. Today almost 90% of the fastest supercomputers out of 500 run on Linux variants including the top 10 supercomputers.

Now that we know what Linux is let's learn some basic commands of Linux
