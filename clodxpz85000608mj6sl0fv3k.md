### What is Package Management?

Package management in Linux refers to the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages on a Linux-based operating system. It's a fundamental component of maintaining a Linux system and ensuring that the software installed on it is up-to-date, secure, and well-integrated.

Everything related to the management of those packages is called Package Management

### Different Types of Package Management Tools

Different Linux system comes with different package management tools such as YUM/DNF, RPM, APT, Flatpak, Snap etc

But, Today we will learn about YUM/DNF, RPM and APT Package Managers

### YUM/DNF Package Manager

Yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is a package manager used in Red Hat-based Linux distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora. It simplifies the installation, updating, and removal of software packages. Yum automatically handles dependencies and connects to software repositories to fetch and manage packages. It's a command-line tool that makes software management more efficient in these Linux distributions.

* YUM is a primary package Management Tool for Redhat
    
* YUM performs dependency resolution when installing, updating and removing software packages
    
* YUM can manage packages from installed repositories in the system or from .rpm packages.
    

### How to use YUM in Linux?

We will look at some of the commands with the YUM package manager. commands such as install, remove, upgrade etc.

* How to install a package using YUM
    

```bash
yum install nginx -y
```

* How to remove the package using YUM
    

```bash
yum remove nginx
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698725789864/32c9e6ec-29f5-4c8b-9522-30bfede4f0c5.png align="center")

* How to update a package using YUM
    

```bash
yum update nginx
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698725851754/65c40801-35ef-4f3e-8cf4-837c0a882407.png align="center")

Since we have installed nginx just now, it is a fresh update therefore we cannot see any updates there, but if you're version of nginx is old then you can easily update it with the update command.

* How to upgrade a package using YUM
    

```bash
yum upgrade nginx
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698725937640/0297c6fd-2d62-48eb-8c25-3f8f73c347d0.png align="center")

The same goes for the upgrade part. It is the latest version we have just now installed therefore there are now current upgrades available.

### Difference between YUM UPDATE & YUM UPGRADE?

Update: It will keep the old packages, so we can roll back to the previous one if the new one has issues.

Upgrade: It will delete the old packages and will install the latest version.

### How to check all the options of the YUM?

```bash
yum -options
```

This will list out all the options of the YUM package manager

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726033734/2a3c3afa-661b-4994-8796-0c1ac9bccfab.png align="center")

There are many more commands available further below. these are just the ones that are fitted in the screenshot.

### How to check available updates for packages in YUM?

```bash
yum check-update
```

This will list out names of all the packages that can be updated.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726129315/e20d3265-6225-48bd-a5ba-440b006c9e02.png align="center")

The packages listed above can be updated to the latest version using the update command.

### How to check history using YUM

```bash
yum history
```

We use the `history` command to check all the past work that has been done related to the packages `history` command will show you the activity with the date and time.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726196502/1cede140-4e2b-4479-91ba-0efa3fe0f20d.png align="center")

### Undo/Redo with YUM

```bash
yum history undo/redo <id>
```

here, `undo` is also works for `rollback` to the previous update

### Tips

if you're using you're system as a normal user then you will have to use sudo commands before the yum commands.

If you're using it as a root user then you can directly use the commands without using the sudo command.

### RPM Package Manager

The RPM Package Manager, often referred to as RPM, is a package management system for Linux-based operating systems. It is primarily used in Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, and other related distributions. RPM is responsible for:

1. **Packaging:** It creates software packages in the RPM format, which contain the software, metadata, and installation scripts.
    
2. **Installation:** RPM installs software packages on your system, managing dependencies to ensure that all required components are in place.
    
3. **Querying:** It allows users to query the system for installed packages, verifying package information and version details.
    
4. **Updates:** RPM can update software packages by replacing older versions with newer ones.
    
5. **Removal:** It removes packages from the system cleanly, making sure to address any dependencies affected by the removal.
    

* RPM Package Manager is also called RedHat package manager.
    
* using RPM you can install, uninstall and query individual software packages.
    
* RPM maintains a database of installed packages that enable powerful and fast queries.
    

### Limitation of RPM

* RPM cannot manage dependencies like the YUM package manager.
    

### How to use RPM

* How to install a package using RPM
    

```bash
rpm -i package-name
```

* \-i is used to install a package
    

To install an RPM file first you have to download a .rpm file from the web which you can easily do with the wget magic trickðŸª„

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726712166/a410ee04-b523-463a-b048-0a6c59e6f573.png align="center")

Once you see that the file is downloaded then you can use the rpm commands to install the .rpm file

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726767372/7b7c2494-e4b4-4b63-af34-f0f7e0a59295.png align="center")

You can now see that the file is installed without any issue with the rpm package manager.

* How to upgrade a package in RPM
    

```bash
rpm -U package-name
```

* here, capital -U is used to upgrade an RPM package manager
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726881480/74c269ec-74db-4295-ba88-3c5fb5a85534.png align="center")

You can see that the package we have installed is the most up-to-date package and that's why it has no pending upgrades.

### Another way to install with RPM and show the progress bar

```bash
rpm -ivh package-name
```

* \-i stands for install
    
* \-v stands for verbose
    
* \-h is used to show the hash rate (progress bar)
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698726986013/9b609afe-f37c-4ce4-8c4e-a57c2669eb4a.png align="center")

### How to delete a file using RPM

```bash
rpm -evh package-name
```

* \-e stands for erase (remove/uninstall)
    
* \-v stands for verbose
    
* \-h stands for the hash rate (progress bar)

### DNF Package Manager

DNF (Dandified YUM) is a modern package manager primarily used in Red Hat-based Linux distributions like Fedora and CentOS. It serves as a command-line tool for installing, updating, and managing software packages on these systems. `dnf` is an improved and more user-friendly replacement for the older `Yum` package manager.

### Some dnf commands:

Moving ahead, let's see about the APT package manager.

### APT Package Manager

**APT (Advanced Package Tool)** is a package management system used in Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Debian and Ubuntu. It simplifies the installation, updating, and removal of software packages. APT manages a vast repository of pre-compiled software packages, making it easy for users to access and maintain their systems with a few simple commands. It handles dependencies, ensuring that all required components for a particular software package are installed. APT is known for its reliability, and it is often used through commands like `apt-get` and `apt`.

* APT is also known as the Advance Packaging Tool.
    
* APT is very similar to YUM commands.
    
* APT is generally used for Debian systems like Ubuntu, Kali Linux etc.
    

### Some APT Commands:

## Practical Tasks:

1. ### How to install Docker on the system using the package manager?
    

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies, making it easy to deploy and run the same software consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies software development, testing, and deployment by providing a standardized way to package and manage applications.

To perform this task we will use the apt package manager. Since I'm using Ubuntu 23.10. The APT package manager is my default package manager.

1. Set up Docker's `apt` repository.
    

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

To install docker on your system you can use the following commands. These are not just some random commands but are from Docker's official website.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698729547212/f55075d5-fa2e-460f-994d-1daa3b6f423a.png align="center")

1. Install the Docker packages.
    

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698729641348/0346ee0b-46f0-4472-93ec-28cc74cfe14a.png align="center")

1. Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the `hello-world` image.
    

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698730007771/d52e3479-a8fe-4171-b2c5-0d3e68b3c3cd.png align="center")

If you see this output, then you have successfully installed and started the Docker engine.

1. ### How to install Jenkins on the system using the package manager?
    

Jenkins is like a digital assistant for software developers. It helps them build and release their software more easily. Think of it as a robot that can automatically do repetitive tasks, like testing the code and sending it to the server when it's ready. This saves time and makes sure everything works smoothly in the software development process.

To install Jenkins on our system will do:

1. Check if you already have <mark>JAVA</mark> installed on your system
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698730317678/b58b5ec1-6162-4d70-847b-8928dd181d8d.png align="center")

1. Start by importing the GPG key. The GPG key verifies package integrity but there is no output
    

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698731743167/5c27c789-767b-4e32-9c60-39bac159b7de.png align="center")

1. Add the Jenkins software repository to the source list and provide the authentication key:
    

```bash
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

As you can see above, Jenkins has been successfully installed on our system.

### What is Systemctl?

Systemctl is a command in Linux used to manage system services. It allows you to start, stop, restart, enable, disable, and check the status of services, making it a crucial tool for controlling and monitoring system processes and daemons.

### What is Systemd?

Systemd is a system and service manager in Linux that handles the startup, management, and control of system processes and services. It's a replacement for the traditional System V init system and provides features like parallel startup, service dependencies, logging, and more.

### Some commands of Systemctl:

1. `systemctl start service-name`: Start a specific service.
    
2. `systemctl stop service-name`: Stop a specific service.
    
3. `systemctl restart service-name`: Restart a specific service.
    
4. `systemctl status service-name`: Check the status of a service.
    
5. `systemctl enable service-name`: Enable a service to start at boot.
    
6. `systemctl disable service-name`: Disable a service from starting at boot.
    
7. `systemctl list-units --type=service`: List all active services.
    
8. `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service`: List all available services.
    

Note: To enable all these services you need to have admin rights.

### Systemctl Tasks:

1. check the status of the Docker Service in your system
    

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698732336052/021987bd-23b6-4c40-8b12-3f8045706148.png align="center")

1. stop the service, Jenkins

you can see that the jenkins service is active on our system and now let's stop the Jenkins service

```bash
systemctl stop jenkins
systemctl status jenkins
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698732479945/395a2f2c-1a05-412d-b163-3d3e602aa455.png align="center")
