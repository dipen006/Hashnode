> Day 1 of #90daysofdevops

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development and IT operations, DevOps has emerged as a transformative paradigm. Today let us learn about what DevOps is and its other fundamentals such as Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure etc.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture it is a methodology where the work of Software Development and Operations take place. If you carefully look at the DevOps word you'll get to know that it is a combined word of Development and Operations.

### DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps lifecycle consists of 7 stages which are:

* `Continuous Development`
    
* `Continuous Integration`
    
* `Continuous Testing`
    
* `Continuous Development/ Continuous Delivery`
    
* `Continuous Monitoring`
    
* `Continuous Feedback`
    
* `Continuous Monitoring`
    

## What is Automation?

Automation in DevOps is the magic wand that empowers efficiency, allowing repetitive tasks to vanish into thin air.

It is the practice of using specialized software tools and methodologies to automate repetitive and manual tasks throughout the software development cycle. some examples include

1. Continuous Integration (CI): This means that when you make changes to the code, a computer checks those changes right away to make sure they don't cause any problems.
    
2. Continuous Delivery (CD): When all the tests show that the code changes are okay, the computer automatically puts those changes into action, so they're used in the real system.
    
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): This is like giving the computer a set of instructions written in code to build and manage things like servers and networks, instead of doing it by hand.
    
4. Automated Testing: Instead of people testing the software, a computer does it automatically using special tools. This reduces the chances of mistakes and makes the software better.
    

## What is Scaling?

Scaling is a very critical component of DevOps. It can be understood as making your website or app strong enough to handle lots of people using it all at once. It's the secret to keeping things running smoothly, no matter how busy it gets!. Some examples of scaling include

1. Horizontal Scaling: Think of this like adding more cash registers in a store when it gets busy. We just make more copies of the same thing to handle more customers.
    
2. Vertical Scaling: This is like giving your computer a boost by making it more powerful, like adding a bigger engine to a car. It helps the same computer do more work.
    
3. Load Balancing: Imagine a traffic cop directing cars at a busy intersection. Load balancing is like that traffic cop, making sure that all the cars (or users) go to the right places, so everything moves smoothly and quickly.
    

## What is Infrastructure?

Infrastructure is like the foundation of a house in DevOps. It's all the stuff, both physical and virtual, that you need to make your apps and services work. few examples are

1. Cloud Computing: This is like renting space on the internet to run your stuff instead of buying your own servers. It's like renting a house instead of owning one.
    
2. Containers: Think of these as small, self-contained boxes for your apps. They make it easy to move and manage your apps, like packing your things in neat, separate boxes when moving.
    
3. Configuration Management: It's like having a smart assistant that makes sure all your stuff is set up just right. It keeps things consistent and reduces mistakes when dealing with servers and networks.
    

### Summary

DevOps is a revolutionary approach that merges software development and IT operations, encompassing stages like Continuous Development, Integration, Testing, Delivery, Monitoring, and Feedback. Automation within DevOps streamlines tasks, such as Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure as Code, and Automated Testing, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Scaling strategies are vital for handling high user loads, with Horizontal Scaling involving adding more system copies and Vertical Scaling increasing the power of a single system. Load Balancing optimizes traffic distribution. Infrastructure forms the core, involving physical and virtual elements, like servers and networks, with Cloud Computing, Containers, and Configuration Management being key components to ensure seamless functionality.
