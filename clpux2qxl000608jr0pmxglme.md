## **Docker Interview Questions**

Docker is a good topic to ask in DevOps Engineer Interviews, mostly for freshers. One must surely try these questions to be better at Docker.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691906161570/2bf14a00-24d8-493a-a97d-804789c6e06c.jpeg?auto=compress,format&format=webp align="left")

## 🔶 Important Docker Interview Questions

* **What is the Difference between an Image, Container and Engine?**  
    The difference between an Image, Container, and Engine in Docker is:
    
    1. **Image**: A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables. Images are created from Dockerfiles and can be shared and reused.
        
    2. **Container**: An instance of an image that runs as a separate process in an isolated environment. Containers are portable and can be started, stopped, and moved between environments, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the host system.
        
    3. **Engine**: The core component of Docker that manages containers. It includes the Docker CLI (command-line interface) and Docker Daemon (server), responsible for building, running, and managing containers and images.
        

An image is packaged software, a container is a running instance of an image, and the engine manages containers and images within the Docker environment.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **What is the Difference between the Docker command COPY vs ADD?**  
    The difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in Docker is:
    
    1. **COPY**: Copies files or directories from the host machine to the container. It only supports basic file copying.
        
    2. **ADD**: Similar to `COPY`, but with additional features. It can also retrieve remote URLs, extract compressed files, and automatically handle URLs.
        

In most cases, using `COPY` is recommended for simple file copying, while `ADD` should be used when you need the additional features it provides.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **What is the Difference between the Docker command CMD vs RUN?**  
    The difference between `CMD` and `RUN` in Docker is:
    
    1. **CMD**: Defines the default command to be executed when a container starts. It's often used for the primary application process within the container. If multiple `CMD` instructions are provided, only the last one takes effect.
        
    2. **RUN**: Executes a command during the image build process to install software, set up configurations, or perform other tasks. The results of the `RUN` command are saved in the image's layers.
        

In essence, `CMD` is used to specify the default behavior when the container starts, while `RUN` is used to execute commands during image creation.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **How Will you reduce the size of the Docker image?**  
    Reduce Docker image size by using smaller base images, optimizing layers, minimizing dependencies, leveraging multi-stage builds, cleaning up caches, and excluding unnecessary files using .dockerignore.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **Why and when to use Docker?**  
    Use **Docker** when you want consistent app behavior, isolation from the host, resource efficiency, easy scaling, streamlined development, microservices support, CI/CD integration, legacy app maintenance, hybrid cloud deployment, and infrastructure automation.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **Explain the Docker components and how they interact with each other.**  
    Docker components interact like the below:
    
    1. **Docker Engine**: The core of Docker, it manages containers. It includes the Docker CLI (commands) and Docker Daemon (server).
        
    2. **Docker Image**: A template with the app, libraries, and settings. Created from a Dockerfile.
        
    3. **Docker Container**: An instance of an image. It runs the app in an isolated environment.
        
    4. **Docker Registry**: Stores images. Docker Hub is a popular public registry.
        
    5. **Docker Compose**: Defines and manages multi-container apps using a YAML file.
        
    6. **Interaction**: We use the Docker CLI to build images from Dockerfile. Images are stored in the registry. Containers are created from images. Docker Compose can spin up multiple containers with defined settings and connections.
        

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Explain the terminology: Docker Compose, Docker File, Docker Image, Docker Container?**
    
    1. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes for your application in a YAML file, making it easier to spin up and manage complex applications with multiple interconnected containers.  
        **Example:** Think of it like a recipe that lists all the ingredients (containers), how they're prepared (settings), and how they're served together (networking) to create a complete dish (application).
        
    2. **Docker File**: A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, environment setup, application dependencies, and commands to execute when creating the image.  
        **Example:** Imagine it as a set of cooking instructions that tell you how to assemble all the ingredients (code, libraries, settings) into a ready-to-cook package (image).
        
    3. **Docker Image**: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables. Images are built from Dockerfiles and can be shared and reused.  
        **Example:** Picture it as a frozen meal that contains everything needed for a specific dish, like lasagna. It's ready to be heated up and served (run) whenever you need it.
        
    4. **Docker Container**: A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It encapsulates the application and its environment in an isolated process with its filesystem, networking, and resources. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be started, stopped, and moved between environments.  
        **Example:** Think of it as a plate with a hot, ready-to-eat portion of a frozen meal (image). You can enjoy it now and throw away the plate later (destroy the container).
        

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* I**n what real scenarios have you used Docker?**  
    Docker is commonly used for microservices deployment, CI/CD automation, reproducible development environments, isolated testing, application scalability, hybrid cloud setups, legacy software support, service orchestration, database management, and disaster recovery.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **Docker vs Hypervisor?**
    
    * Docker is ideal for lightweight, portable, and scalable applications, especially those built on microservices architecture.
        
    * Hypervisors are suitable for running multiple OSes and legacy applications that require strong isolation.
        

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using docker?**  
    **Docker offers several advantages:**
    
    * **Consistency**: Ensures consistent application behavior across different environments.
        
    * **Isolation**: Isolates applications and dependencies, preventing conflicts.
        
    * **Efficiency**: Uses resources efficiently due to containerization.
        
    * **Portability**: Easily moves applications between different systems.
        
    * **Rapid Deployment**: Swiftly deploys and scales applications.
        
    * **Version Control**: Tracks changes to images and facilitates rollbacks.
        

**Docker has some disadvantages:**

* **Security Concerns**: Containers share the host OS kernel, raising security risks.
    
* **Resource Overhead**: Containers may consume more resources than expected.
    
* **Complex Networking**: Networking setups can be complex in distributed systems.
    
* **Limited GUI Apps**: Challenging to run GUI applications within containers.
    
* **Persistence**: Data persistence requires managing volumes.
    
* **Compatibility Issues**: Compatibility can be an issue with older software.
    

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **What is a Docker namespace?**  
    Docker uses namespaces **to provide the isolated workspace called the container**. When we run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
    
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **What is a Docker registry?**  
    A Docker registry stores and shares Docker images eg. **Docker Hub**.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **What is an entry point?**  
    The Docker **ENTRYPOINT** is a command that defines the default executable that should be run when a container is started from an image. It is specified in the Dockerfile and serves as the main process within the container.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **How to implement CI/CD in Docker?**  
    Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in Docker involves setting up a pipeline that automates the building, testing, and deployment of your Dockerized applications. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement CI/CD using Docker:
    
    1. **Dockerize**: Create a Dockerfile to package your app with its dependencies.
        
    2. **Automated Testing**: Set up automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) to ensure app stability.
        
    3. **CI Tool**: Use CI tools like **Jenkins**, GitLab CI/CD to trigger tests on code changes.
        
    4. **Docker Image Repo**: Store Docker images in repositories like "**Docker Hub**".
        
    5. **Automated Deployment**: Configure pipelines for auto-deployment based on test success.
        
    6. **Infrastructure as Code**: Define infrastructure using **Terraform** or **CloudFormation**.
        
    7. **Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage containers.
        
    8. **Continuous Deployment**: Deploy app updates automatically upon test success.
        
    9. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools for app health and performance.
        
    10. **Feedback and Iteration**: Learn from deployments and improve processes.
        

By following these steps, we can streamline development, testing, and deployment using Docker and CI/CD practices.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Will data on the container be lost when the docker container exits?**
    
    Yes, by default, the data within a Docker container will be lost when the container exits.  
    To preserve data between container runs, you can use Docker volumes or bind mounts. Volumes provide a way to store data outside of the container's filesystem, ensuring that the data persists even when the container is removed. Bind mounts allow you to map a directory on the host machine to a directory within the container, enabling data to be shared and persisted between the host and the container.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **What is a Docker swarm?**
    
    ```bash
      #Swarm This command works with the Swarm orchestrator.
      docker swarm COMMAND
    ```
    
    A Docker Swarm operates as a conductor for managing Docker applications. It's designed to unite containers into a collective group called a cluster. Within this cluster, a central swarm manager takes charge of orchestrating various activities. The machines that become part of this collaborative setup are called nodes, contributing to a harmonized and organized container ecosystem.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
* **What are the docker commands for the following:**
    
    * **view running containers**
        
        ```bash
          docker ps
          #ps - process status
        ```
        
    * **command to run the container under a specific name**
        
        ```bash
          docker run --name
        ```
        
    * **command to export a docker**
        
        ```bash
          docker export [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
        ```
        
    * **command to import an already existing docker image**
        
        ```bash
          docker import [OPTIONS] file|URL|- [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]
        ```
        
    * **commands to delete a container**
        
        ```bash
          docker rm [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
        ```
        
    * **command to remove all stopped containers, unused networks, build caches, and dangling images?**
        
        ```bash
          docker system prune --all
        ```
        

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **What are the common Docker practices to reduce the size of Docker Images?**
    
    To reduce the size of Docker images, follow these common practices:
    
    * Merge steps in Dockerfile to fewer layers.
        
    * Use small base images (e.g., Alpine).
        
    * Employ multi-stage builds for smaller final images.
        
    * Trim unnecessary dependencies.
        
    * Utilize .dockerignore to exclude needless files.
        
    * Compress files inside images.
        
    * Clean package manager caches.
        
    * Remove temporary files post installations.
        
    * Optimize layer order for caching.
        
    * Minimize installed software components.
