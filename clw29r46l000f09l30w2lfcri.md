## **Docker Cheatsheet**

**1\. Docker Basics:**

* **Docker Image**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
    
* **Docker Container**: An instance of a Docker image that can be executed and run as an isolated process.
    

**2\. Docker Commands:**

* **docker run**: Create and start a new container based on an image.
    
* **docker build**: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
    
* **docker pull**: Download a Docker image from a registry.
    
* **docker push**: Upload a Docker image to a registry.
    
* **docker stop**: Stop a running container.
    
* **docker start**: Start a stopped container.
    
* **docker restart**: Restart a running container.
    
* **docker exec**: Run a command inside a running container.
    

**3\. Dockerfile:**

* A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.
    
* Uses a simple syntax to specify the base image, dependencies, environment variables, and commands to run.
    
* Example Dockerfile:
    
    ```bash
    FROM ubuntu:latest
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
    CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
    ```
    

**4\. Docker Registry:**

* A centralized location where Docker images are stored and can be shared.
    
* Popular registries include Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, and Google Container Registry.
    
* Allows you to upload and download Docker images.
    

**5\. Docker Compose:**

* A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
    
* Uses a YAML file to configure the services, networks, and volumes for the application.
    
* Simplifies the management of complex Docker setups.
    
* Example docker-compose.yml:
    
    ```bash
    version: '3'
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
        volumes:
          - .:/code
    ```
    

**6\. Docker Networking:**

* Docker provides networking capabilities to enable communication between containers and other networked entities.
    
* Supports various network drivers such as bridge, overlay, host, and macvlan.
    
* Containers can be connected to multiple networks for different use cases.
    

**7\. Docker Volumes:**

* A mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
    
* Allows data to be shared between containers and persisted beyond the lifecycle of a container.
    
* Can be managed using Docker commands or Docker Compose.
    

**8\. Docker Security:**

* Docker provides several security features to protect containers and the host system.
    
* Includes capabilities such as user namespaces, SELinux/AppArmor, container isolation, and image signing.
    
* Regularly update Docker and base images to patch security vulnerabilities.
    

**9\. Docker Best Practices:**

* Keep Docker images lightweight by minimizing the number of layers and removing unnecessary dependencies.
    
* Use multi-stage builds to optimize Dockerfile size and build times.
    
* Avoid running containers as root whenever possible for improved security.
    
* Monitor container resource usage and scale as needed to ensure performance and reliability.
    

Remember, Docker is a powerful tool for containerization, but it's essential to understand its concepts and best practices to use it effectively in your development and deployment workflows.
