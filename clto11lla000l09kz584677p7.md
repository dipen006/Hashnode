## Introduction

Linux commands may seem daunting at first, but they're the key to navigating and controlling your system. Let's break down some basic Linux commands in simple language:

## Tasks

1. ### To view what's written in a file.
    

In Linux, the `cat` command stands for "concatenate" and is used to display the contents of a file.

* To display the content of a file:
    
    ```bash
    cat filename.txt
    ```

    2. ### To change the access permissions of files.
        
    
    the `chmod` command in Linux is used to change the access permissions of a file or directory.
    
* To make a script executable:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x script.sh
    ```
    
* before/after changing permission

    3. ### To check which commands you have run till now.
        
    
    the `history` command in Linux is used to display a list of recently executed commands in the terminal.
    
* to check history of your commands
    

```bash
history
```

4. ### To remove a directory/folder
    

the `rm -r` command in Linux is used to remove directories (folders) and their contents.

* to remove directory/folder
    

```bash
rm -r foldername/directory_name
```

* `rm`: Stands for "remove," and it is used for deleting files or directories.
    
* `-r`: Stands for "recursive." This option allows `rm` to delete not only the specified directory but also its entire contents, including subdirectories and files.

5. ### Command to create fruits.txt and view to content
    

To create a file named `fruits.txt` and view its content, you can use a combination of the `touch` and `cat` commands.

* **Create the**`fruits.txt` file:
    

```bash
touch fruits.txt
```

* Add some contents to fruits.txt
    

```bash
echo "Apple" >> fruits.txt
echo "Banana" >> fruits.txt
echo "Orange" >> fruits.txt
```

* To view the contents of fuits.txt
    

```bash
cat fruits.txt
```

6. ### Add conent in devops.txt (one in each line) - Apple, Mango, Banana, Cherry, Kiwi, Orange, Guava
    

You can use a single `echo` command with the help of a newline character to add all the fruits to the `devops.txt` file at once.

* `echo -e`: Enables interpretation of backslash escapes, including the newline character.
    
* `"Apple\nMango\nBanana\nCherry\nKiwi\nOrange\nGuava"`: Represents the list of fruits, each separated by a newline character (`\n`).
    
* `> devops.txt`: Redirects the output to the `devops.txt` file, overwriting its content if it already exists.
    

```bash
echo -e "Apple\nMango\nBanana\nCherry\nKiwi\nOrange\nGuava" > devops.txt
```

7. ### To show only top 3 fruits from the file
    

To show only the top 3 fruits from the `devops.txt` file, you can use the `head` command.

* To show top 3 fruits from devops.txt
    

```bash
head -n 3 devops.txt
```

8. ### To show only bottom 3 fruits from the file
    

To show only the bottom 3 fruits from the `devops.txt` file, you can use the `tail` command.

* To show bottom 3 fruits from devops.txt
    

```bash
tail -n 3 devops.txt
```

9. ### To create another file colors.txt and to display the content
    

You can use the `touch` command to create the `Colors.txt` file and then use a text editor or the `echo` command to add content. Here's a set of commands to achieve this:

* **Create the**`Colors.txt`**file:**
    
    ```bash
    touch Colors.txt
    ```
    
    This command creates an empty file named `Colors.txt` in the current directory.
    
* **Add content to**`Colors.txt`**:** You can use a text editor or the `echo` command to add content. Here's an example using `echo`:
    
    ```bash
    echo "Red" >> Colors.txt
    echo "Blue" >> Colors.txt
    echo "Green" >> Colors.txt
    echo "Yellow" >> Colors.txt
    ```
    
* **View the content of**`Colors.txt`**:**
    
    ```bash
    cat Colors.txt
    ```
    
    The `cat` command displays the content of the `Colors.txt` file on the terminal.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710226145956/a680a68f-3408-4bfb-8945-3e2ab25fd759.png align="center")
    
    The file shown is blank because I have't wrote anything in the file.
    

10. ### Add content in colors.txt (one in each line) - Red, Pink, White, Blue, Purple, Black, Orange, Grey
    

You can use a single `echo` command with the help of a newline character to add all the fruits to the `colors.txt` file at once.

* `echo -e`: Enables interpretation of backslash escapes, including the newline character.
    
* `"Red\nPink\nWhite\nBlue\nPurple\nBlack\nOreange\nGrey"`: Represents the list of fruits, each separated by a newline character (`\n`).
    
* `> colors.txt`: Redirects the output to the `colors.txt` file, overwriting its content if it already exists.
    

```bash
echo -e "Red\nPink\nWhite\nBlue\nPurple\nBlack\nOreange\nGrey" > colors.txt
```

11. ### Find Difference between fruits.txt and colors.txt
    

To find the differences between the contents of `fruits.txt` and `Colors.txt` files, you can use the `diff` command.

* To find difference between fruits.txt and colors.txt
    

```bash
diff fruits.txt Colors.txt
```
